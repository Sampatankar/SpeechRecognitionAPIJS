# SpeechRecognitionAPIJS
20/20: Speech Recognition API - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This project is a guessing game where you are able to speak your guess, of a number between 1 and 100 into the microphone. The speech recognition API then converts your spoken guess into a visible number on screen and checks it against the number that would win.

The project will display a UI directing the user to speak their guessed number.  The speech recognition will be attached to microphone access.  It will process the user's guess and match it.  The user will be notified whether they need to guess higher, lower, if they have a match or if what they voiced was not a number.

This is the 20th and final project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
